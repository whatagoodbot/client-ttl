You need to create a secrets.json file and add your own GIPHY_API_KEY, CHAT_AUTH_TOKEN, and BEARER_TOKEN in a single json object

Configured for a few rooms so far but you can just change the room UUID etc. at the top
Under vard/, add a new aliases_[room slug here].json file for every room e.g. aliases_myroom.json

Commands as of 8 Sep 2022: /ro, /giphy [query], /alias [name] [gif], /aliases, /dadjoke, /weather
